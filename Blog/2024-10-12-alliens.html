        It all started with a bizarre binary message. Decoding it revealed I was hired by aliens needing a website for their interstellar travel agency. They had one firm request: none of our Earthly ad-tech nonsense.

"Why is your web so full of garbage?" they asked. "Pop-ups, auto-playing videos, endless tracking—it's like navigating a minefield!" I couldn't argue. The web had become an ad-infested wasteland.

Their site was a revelation—no ads, no pop-ups, no trackers. Just pure, unadulterated content. It felt like a breath of fresh air, a much needed blast of cosmic radiation.

Maybe one day, Earth will catch on.
