      My name is Tarun. I enjoy making websites and teaching others to do the same. I started writing an HTML web book because I think everyone should have a personal website and I want to show that you don't have to be a computer science graduate to make one.

      I'm a side project enthusiast and have put various sites, apps, and (bad) games into the world. My hobbies include web-related nerdery, D&D and board games, and writing. I like to participate in National Novel Writing Month, the annual novel-writing challenge
